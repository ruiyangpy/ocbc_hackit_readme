User research
•	The purpose of the Home Page displaying “Login” and “Sign Up” button is more user friendly towards first time users for easier navigation. User studies conducted shows that most apps usually show them the login page and they have difficulties finding the sign up button.

•	The purpose of the fancy ‘Welcome’ sign or anything fancy can draw first time user’s attention in using the app.

•	The purpose of bold fonts is user friendly towards elderly and those that have poor vision. User studies conducted shows that the screens of mobile devices are small and users need their spectacles to be able to view the words on their mobile devices.

•	The purpose of the image in the Reset Password page is to draw the user’s attention when they are waiting the password reset link to be sent to them. User studies conducted have shown resetting passwords can be a frustrating process and sometimes they will just close the app.

•	The purpose of displaying the images of Popular movies in bigger sizes are useful when discussing with friends on what movies to watch with a single movie device. User studies conducted shows that the success rate on everyone agreeing to watch the same movie under the Popular section is higher than that of the Currently Showing section.

•	The purpose of the favourites list is for users to decide on what movie to watch. User studies conducted shows that users tend to be pickier on movies, because they do not watch movie that often. The favourites list will help users to navigate through the movies they are interested in more easily.



•	The purpose of the user profile is for the ease of access for users when booking a movie. Personal information can be automatically filled for them when booking a movie. User studies conducted have shown that users prefer their personal information such as their name and phone number to be automatically filled for them.
